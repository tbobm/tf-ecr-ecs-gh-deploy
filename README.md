# Automated ECS deployments

Create the AWS infrastructure (ECS, ECR, ALB, ...) to deploy a container and
automatically update it using Github Action.

Example run is available [here][ci-success].

_Hey, considering some people forked this project I made a Terraform Module
based on the resources I used in this repository. It is available at
[github.com/tbobm/terraform-aws-ecs][gh-tf-module] and it is already available
in the Terraform Registry at [tbobm/ecs][tf-registry-ecs]._

## Core components/

### AWS

The AWS infrastructure is setup using terraform in the [`./terraform`](./terraform).

The following components are deployed:

- Application Load Balancer ([`./lb.tf`](./terraform/lb.tf))
- ECS Cluster / ECS Service ([`./ecs.tf`](./terraform/ecs.tf))
- Elastic Container Registry ([`./ecr.tf`](./terraform/ecr.tf))
- IAM permissions ([`./iam.tf`](./terraform/iam.tf))
- VPC configuration ([`./vpc.tf`](./terraform/vpc.tf))

### CI/CD

The repository leverages the [AWS Github Actions](https://github.com/aws-actions/)
maintained by AWS.

The main goal is to provide an example configuration of the following workflow:

- Run the integration tests
- Build the Docker image
- Publish it to a private ECR
- Update the corresponding ECS Service (by editing the task image)
